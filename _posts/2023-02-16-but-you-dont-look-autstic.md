Put yourself into the eyes of someone with autismâ€¦ wait that's not how that goes, metaphors are hard. As someone who grew up in an autistic house, I knew we were different, but not why and what to do about it. After stumbling through life, here's what I'd like to share about autism. Wait, shoes!

An in depth look into autism and how people with autism function in the workplace.

This talk goes through:

- Personal history and experiences
  - I've been diagnosed for 15 years and majored psychology at university to learn more
  - How autism is diagnosed including criteria and levels of autism
- Including the history of autism
  - Debunking some common myths and stereotypes
  - Strengths and weaknesses
- Real life min/maxing
  - Workplace consideration and accommodations

Asking people what they need and believing them helps everyone
I'm hoping by sharing my experiences you'll be able to gain some insight on how to help others, or yourself if you identify with what I've been saying a little too much.
